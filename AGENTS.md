# Task List

- [ ] Investigate low coverage in CI
- [ ] Install required dependencies for full test suite
- [ ] Add tests for utility modules
- [ ] Ensure overall coverage >= 80%

Current objective: achieve 80% coverage across the repository. Start by adding lightweight tests for modules that do not require heavy dependencies and run them under pytest with coverage.
