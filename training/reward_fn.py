"""Alias-aware fact-check reward utilities.

This module extends the basic graph-based reward function by resolving
entity aliases through a Neo4j full-text index. The reward is computed as

.. math::

    R = \frac{N_\text{facts} + N_\text{alias}}{N_\text{facts}}

where :math:`N_\text{facts}` counts exact matches between extracted
triplets and the knowledge graph while :math:`N_\text{alias}` counts
matches found after alias canonicalisation via ``apoc.text.clean``.

    ----------
    driver:
        Active Neo4j driver. When ``None`` the function falls back to the
        identity mapping which keeps the entity unchanged. This allows the
        reward function to operate without Neo4j during tests.
    name:
        Raw entity name possibly containing punctuation or casing
        variations.

    set of str
        Set of canonical names obtained through ``apoc.text.clean`` and a
        full-text index named ``alias``. If no mapping is found the original

    The returned callable extracts triplets from a model ``response`` and
    verifies them against ``graph``. When a triplet is not found directly,
    the subjects and objects are canonicalised through Neo4j to discover
    alias matches. The reward is the ratio of validated facts—either exact
    or via alias—over the number of extracted facts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph:
        Knowledge graph mapping ``(subject, predicate)`` pairs to a set of
        accepted objects.
    driver:
        Neo4j driver providing access to the alias index. ``None`` skips alias
        resolution, useful for offline tests.

    -------
