"""Admission webhook enforcing per-tenant GPU credit quotas.

This module exposes a small :mod:`fastapi` application that estimates the
GPU time required for a training job and rejects the request if the tenant lacks
sufficient credits.  Remaining credits are exported via a Prometheus gauge so
external billing systems can scrape the balance.

The admission controller computes the expected GPU minutes using

.. math::

    E_{gpu} = t_{epoch} \cdot n_{epoch}

where ``t_epoch`` is the duration in minutes of a single epoch and ``n_epoch``
is the number of epochs in the submitted job.  When ``E_gpu`` exceeds the
available credits the webhook responds with HTTP ``403`` to signal that the job
should not be scheduled.
